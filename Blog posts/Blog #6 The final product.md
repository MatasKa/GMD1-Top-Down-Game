**So, after all of the blogs, milestones and commits, this is how the game looks, works, and how it is played.**

#***RogueBit***

A rogue-like style game, where you fight various monsters to earn gold, get better weapons and upgrades, and defeat the final boss.
Before a run starts, you can sellect a class that you will play. There are three of them:

After that, you will spawn in to the "Arena", where the main action happens. This is where you will defeat waves of monsters,
while shopping for better gear during the time-outs. You can relax as much as you like, but you can't progress without beating the enemies.

Do not forget to use your gold, to buy better weapons, but do take a look at what requirements they need, so that if you decide on one, you know
what stat to upgrade with the potions. Be mindful when rerolling, as keeping some extra gold coins for the next wave might prove usefull.

You will need to defeat ten waves of enemies, every second one being a harder variant, as the enemy pool gets bigger, and stronger monsters start spawning.
After the nine waves, you will fight with the final boss, which will be a bullet-hell style boss fight (still made to be quite easy, but relatively fun).

## **What could still be added**
While the game is functional, beatable and dare I say, quite fun, it does do a few things that either would need changing, or simply adding more of.
One of the weakest part of this project is sound. It does have a few sounds - a player hit sfx, and a enemy shoot sfx. However, two small sound effects are
nowhere near what a full game should have, but with how I planned my time, this was one of the shortcomings.

I also did do spreadsheets and stuff to try and balance the game, so it is not too hard, but also not so easy that could be beaten with one's eyes closed.
Still, I feel like it could do a lot more work to be balanced in a more fun way, as right now it does lean quite a lot to the easier side. This was also a
choice, as I would have rather have the game too easy than too hard.

apart from a few other smaller changes, I am proud of the result (except maybe the third's milestone execution), and may continue the project for fun later on.

If you will try it, good luck, and most importantly, have fun :)
