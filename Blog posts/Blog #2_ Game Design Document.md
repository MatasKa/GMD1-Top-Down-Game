# **Blog #2: Game Design Document**

This is the Game Design Document for my GMD1 course game. So far, this is not the final version, and the decisions that are still not finalized will be marked like `this`.

## **The Main Concept/Idea:**
`*Insert a game title here*` is a Top-Down 2D Rouge-Like game, where a player will go trough waves of enemies or levels to earn gold, and purchase upgrades for their kit.

## **The Current Gameplay Loop:**
1. A player enters a level.
2. They start defeating the enemies.
3. They collect gold from said enemies.
4. After all enemies are defeated, a shop opens in the level.
5. In the shop, gold can be spent to get upgrades for the player/weapon.
*This is a point where I have yet to decide which way the game should go, as both side A and side B have their own pros and cons*

A:
6.`After the purchases are made, the player chooses to go through one of the doors, which decide the difficulty of the next level (harder level - more gold)`.
7.`After a certain number of levels, the player will reach a final boss, that if beaten, the player beats/finishes the game`.

Or B:
6.`After a certain amount of preparation/shopping time, a new wave will begin that is harder than the one before`.
7.`The game is endless, and the main goal is to survive as long as possible (survive as many waves of enemies as possible, and try to beat the previous highscore)`.

## **Other Details**
### Enemies
- The number of different "simple" enemies will be at least 5.
- There will also be at least one boss.  `This depends on which way the game will go, if it will be option A, there will probably be one boss, if option B - then probably more`.
- Each enemy will feature a unique design, different HP amounts and different attacks/attack patterns.

### Player
- Before the run begins, the player will be able to choose one of the `potentially 3` characters, each one having different stats/quirks/ablities.
- If the player dies, the game is over.
- `The player will be able to take some damage before dying`.
- `The player will not be able to heal himself`.

### Shop and Weapons
- The player will have a weapon, which they will be able to change by buying another one from the shop `or getting one from a boss`.
- Each weapon will also feature a unique design, different damage stats and different attacks or abilities.
- There will be at least 10 different weapons.
- The shop will have some choice of weapons `and upgrades` for the player.

### Style/Art
- The game will be 2D
- The game will have a top-down perspective
- `The game will use pixel-art`


## The Milestones
1st. The game will have a main menu, featuring at least working start and exit buttons.
It should be possible to enter the game and walk around, which would also have at least the assets for the level, the player and the shop.

2nd. The game will feature at least 5 simple yet different enemies, as well as boss(es).
The player will be able to use a single (starter) weapon, and all enemies will be able to drop gold when killed, but they will also be able to kill the player. 

3rd. The player will be able to choose one of the characters at the start of the run. They will also be able to collect gold and use the shop to get other weapons `and upgrades`.
The game will feature at least 10 weapons with different abilities.
The game will also have the game over screen, `as well as a highscore` or `a game ending when the player beats the final boss`.
