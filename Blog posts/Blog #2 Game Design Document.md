# **Blog #2: Game Design Document**

This is the Game Design Document for my GMD1 course game. So far, this is not the final version, and the decisions that are still not finalized will be marked like `this`.

## **The Main Concept/Idea:**
Roguebit is a Top-Down 2D Rogue-Like game, where a player will go trough waves of enemies or levels to earn gold, and purchase upgrades for their kit.

## **The Current Gameplay Loop:**
1. A player chooses a difficulty (ammount of waves).
2. A player enters a level.
3. They start defeating the enemies.
4. They collect gold from said enemies.
5. After a certain ammount of time the wave ends and a shop opens in the level.
6. In the shop, gold can be spent to get upgrades for the player/weapon.
7.After a certain amount of preparation/shopping time, a new wave will begin that is harder than the one before.
8.The game is ends after every wave in this difficulty was beaten.

## **Other Details**
### Enemies
- The number of different non-boss enemies will be at least 5.
- There will also be at least one boss, `which will have a bullet-hell style boss fight`.
- `Each non-boss enemy will be melee focused, meaning they will not attack with ranged attacks`.

### Player
- Before the run begins, the player will be able to choose one of the `potentially 3` characters, each one having different stats/quirks/ablities.
- If the player dies, the game is over.
- The player will be able to take some damage before dying.

### Shop and Weapons
- The player will have a weapon, which they will be able to change by buying another one from the shop.
- Each weapon will also feature a unique design, different stats and may have a special ability.
- There will be at least 10 different weapons.
- The shop will have some choice of weapons `and upgrades` for the player.
- Items in the shops will be random, but can be "rerolled" for gold.

### Style/Art
- The game will be 2D
- The game will have a top-down perspective
- The game will use pixel-art assets

## The Milestones
1st. The game will have a main menu, featuring a detailed backgorund and working start and exit buttons, but not the character select screen.
It will be possible to enter the "arena" (the level in which the game-loop is) and walk around. The "arena" will have the assets for the level, the shop and the animations for the player.
The player will be able to enter the shop, but only to see the shop screen, not to buy items yet.

2nd. The game should have all of the enemies implemented, as well as 1 `or 2` boss`(es)`. The game will have some sound effects `and some music` implemented as well.
The player will be able to use a single (starter) weapon, and all enemies will be able to drop gold when killed, but they will also be able to kill the player. 

3rd. The player will be able to choose one of the characters at the start of the run. They will also be able to collect gold and use the shop to get other weapons `and upgrades`.
The game will feature at least 10 weapons.
The game will also have the game over screen, as well as a game ending when the player beats the final boss`.
This milestone also includes any polishing depending of how much time is left.
